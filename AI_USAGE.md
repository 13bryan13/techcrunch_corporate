I implemented aspects of the "Google Method" that Sanjay talked about last class to help me prompt AI. The following is the first prompt I gave:
Assume the role of a senior engineer that is familiar with ALL things tech. your job is to help an intern complete the following task with instructions: *instructions* no need to start and try to complete the whole assignment right now. we can start slow and work on brainstorming first. you just tell me everything you need me to do like finding a website or api but we can work on it in chunks without trying to tackle the whole thing at once
I then iterated on this prompt during each new chunk. So, I would use the google method and ask for help, as an intern, on this project.
My next two prompts were "can we do it like this? the user inputs a word that they want to be scraped for. for example, i input "Microsoft" or "blockchain" and the scraper scrapes for the article that mentions that word the most times. then it outputs a summary of the article but it must use the corporate jargon in the summary somewhere"
to give the idea to claude and "can we try to vibe code this keeping in mind the instructions and the format of the final assignment. walk me through everything i need to do on my end"
The goal was to just accomplish one section of the assignment before moving onto the next. So, I first had claude write a skeleton scraper, and then just skeleton code to test the api, and finally integrated them together.
This was a major improvement from last time when I tried to do everything at once and would run into errors and be confused on how to debug because I wouldn't even know which part was causing this error since everything was being generated at once.
